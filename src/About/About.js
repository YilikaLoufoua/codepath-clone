      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>As a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit, we bring together employers, students, and colleges to eliminate inequities in tech education, diversify the field, and provide underrepresented students with a path toward economic mobility and generational wealth.</p>
      <p>Our programming centers the needs and success of Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and low-income Computer Science students. We strategically partner with CS Departments at Colleges and Universities with the highest enrollment numbers for these groups.</p>
